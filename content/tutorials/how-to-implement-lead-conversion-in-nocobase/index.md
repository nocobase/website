## 1. Introduction

This tutorial will guide you step-by-step on how to implement the CRM Opportunity Conversion feature in NocoBase. We will cover how to create the necessary collections, configure data management pages, design the conversion process, and set up association management to help you build the entire business process successfully.

## 2. Preparation: Creating the Required Collections

Before starting, we need to prepare the following four collections and configure the relationships between them.

### 2.1 LEAD Collection (Lead)

This collection is used to store potential customer information. Its field definitions are as follows:


| Field Name     | Display Name       | Field Interface  | Description                                                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id             | **Id**             | Integer          | Primary key                                                                                               |
| account_id     | **account_id**     | Integer          | Foreign key to ACCOUNT                                                                                    |
| contact_id     | **contact_id**     | Integer          | Foreign key to CONTACT                                                                                    |
| opportunity_id | **opportunity_id** | Integer          | Foreign key to OPPORTUNITY                                                                                |
| name           | **Lead Name**      | Single line text | Name of the potential customer                                                                            |
| company        | **Company Name**   | Single line text | Name of the potential customer's company                                                                  |
| email          | **Email**          | Email            | Email address of the potential customer                                                                   |

## 3. Understanding the Opportunity Conversion Process

### 3.1 Overview of the Normal Conversion Process

An opportunity, when converted from a lead, generally goes through the following process:

![20250225211802](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250225211802.png)

### 3.2 Explanation of the Relationships

Assuming you have successfully created the above four collections and configured the mapping relationships among them:

![Relationships](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250225090913.png)

## 4. Creating Data Management Pages

In the NocoBase workspace, create data management pages for each collection and add some sample lead data for subsequent testing.

![Data Management Page](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250224234721.png)

## 5. Implementing the Opportunity Conversion Function

This section focuses on explaining how to convert a lead into company, contact, and opportunity records, and ensuring that the conversion operation is not triggered repeatedly.

### 5.1 Create the "Conversion" Edit Operation

In the lead detail view, create an edit operation named "Conversion". In the conversion modal, configure the following:

#### 5.1.1 Display Lead Basic Information

Display the basic information of the current lead in read-only mode to ensure that users do not accidentally modify the original data.

#### 5.1.2 Display Associated Relationship Fields

In the modal, display the following three association fields and enable the "Quick Create" feature for each. This allows immediate creation of new data if no matching record is found.

![Display Associated Fields](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250224234155.png)

#### 5.1.3 Configure the Default Mapping for Quick Create

In the "Quick Create" modal settings, configure default values for each association field so that the lead information is automatically mapped to the target collection. The mapping rules are as follows:

- Lead/Lead Name → Company/Name
- Lead/Email → Company/Email
- Lead/Phone → Company/Phone
- Lead/Lead Name → Contact/Name
- Lead/Email → Contact/Email
- Lead/Phone → Contact/Phone
- Lead/Lead Name → Opportunity/Name
- Lead/Status → Opportunity/Stage

Configuration example screenshots:

![Default Mapping 1](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250225000218.png)
![Default Mapping 2](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250225001256.png)

#### 5.1.4 Viewing the Conversion Effect

After completing the configuration, when the conversion operation is executed, the system will create and associate new company, contact, and opportunity records based on the mapping rules. The effect is demonstrated below:

Next, we will add a success feedback for the submission operation:

![20250226154952](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250226154952.png)

Submission effect:

### 5.2 Preventing Duplicate Conversions

To avoid converting the same lead multiple times, you can control it in the following ways:

#### 5.2.1 Update Lead Status

In the conversion form submission operation, add an automatic data update step to change the lead status to "Converted".

Configuration screenshots:

![Update Status 1](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250225001758.png)
![Update Status 2](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250225001817.png)
Effect demonstration:
![Conversion Effect](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/202502252130-transfer.gif)

#### 5.2.2 Set Button Linking Rules

Add linking rules to the conversion button: when the lead status is "Converted", automatically hide the conversion button to prevent duplicate operations.

Configuration screenshots:

![Button Linking 2](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250225001939.png)

## 6. Configuring the Association Management Blocks on the Detail Pages

To allow users to view associated data on the detail pages of each Collection, you need to configure the corresponding list blocks or detail blocks.

### 6.1 Configure the Company Collection Detail Page

In the company detail page (for example, within the contact's edit/detail modal), add the following list blocks:

- Contact list block
- Opportunity list block
- Lead list block

Example screenshot:

![Company Detail Page](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250225085418.png)

### 6.2 Add Filter Conditions

For each list block, add filter rules to ensure that only data associated with the current company ID is displayed.

Configuration screenshots:

![Filter Condition 1](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250225085513.png)
![Filter Condition 2](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250225085638.png)

### 6.3 Configure the Contact and Opportunity Detail Pages

In the detail modal of the Contact Collection, add the following blocks:

- Opportunity list block
- Company detail block
- Lead list block (filtered by ID)

Screenshot:

![Contact Detail](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250225090231.png)

In the Opportunity detail page, similarly add:

- Contact list block
- Company detail block
- Lead list block (filtered by ID)
