## What is a Rapid Development Platform?

A rapid development platform, also known as a [Rapid Application Development (RAD)](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/rapid-application-development-best-application-cases) platform, is a development tool designed to accelerate application development and deployment by providing pre-built modules, automated workflows, and simplified programming interfaces. These platforms include both[ low-code](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/top-15-open-source-low-code-projects-with-the-most-github-Stars) and [no-code ](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/the-top-12-open-source-no-code-tools-with-the-most-github-stars)solutions, enabling developers and non-technical users to build applications through visual interfaces and model-driven logic without extensive coding.

**Advantages of Rapid Development Platforms:**

1. **Improved Development Speed**: By using pre-built components and automated workflows, developers can quickly prototype applications, shortening development cycles.
2. **Lower Technical Barriers**: Low-code and no-code platforms enable non-technical users to participate in application development, fostering cross-department collaboration.
