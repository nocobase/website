We previously compiled [the top 10 open-source project management tools by GitHub Star count](https://www.nocobase.com/cn/blog/github-open-source-project-management-tools). This type of content has been widely bookmarked and discussed, and self-hosted, open-source project management tools remain a practical requirement for many teams.

Recently, however, discussions in the [Reddit project management community](https://www.reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1nlsyz0/best_ai_tools_for_project_managers_right_now/) show that more users are focusing on a more direct question — can AI meaningfully support the day-to-day work of project management?

![](https://nocobase.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=Y2JmODhmYjQ1M2Q0OWRhNjc0ZGI0M2ViMTM5YjRkOGJfRHRkWkpsbDB3Vkpia0NCc1NCdmNUVFJVUVkyQmZMQTZfVG9rZW46UHVwU2J5allqb0phblF4VU9IQWN3S3VibkpnXzE3NzAzMTA2MTk6MTc3MDMxNDIxOV9WNA)

In these discussions, many users have begun sharing their hands-on experience:

* Many teams are already using AI to automatically summarize meeting notes and extract action items and task lists from discussions.
* AI is being used to structure project documentation and internal knowledge bases, reducing the time spent searching for information and minimizing repetitive communication.
* Some users are experimenting with using AI for task breakdown, prioritization, and early project risk detection.

The division of project management work is gradually evolving, with AI increasingly handling information organization and analytical tasks. As a result, teams are shifting their expectations of AI from simply improving efficiency to actively supporting core business workflows.

For this reason, this article does not provide a general overview of project management tools. Instead, based on official product information, it selects the TOP 5 open-source tools under the [GitHub project management topic](https://github.com/topics/project-management) that have already integrated AI capabilities or are actively advancing AI-driven collaboration. The article focuses on analyzing their AI features and their practical applications in project management scenarios.
