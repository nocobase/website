Based on user feedback, we decided to make two commercial workflow plugins open-source:

* [JSON Calculation](https://v2.docs.nocobase.com/workflow/nodes/json-query)
* [JSON Variable Mapping](https://v2.docs.nocobase.com/workflow/nodes/json-variable-mapping)

## Why open source?

These plugins are among the most frequently used in workflows and are often required after SQL or HTTP Request nodes. When they were commercial plugins, community-edition users were unable to fully use the HTTP Request node, which created a poor experience. That is why we are making them open-source.

## Plugin overview

### JSON Calculation

Handles complex JSON produced by upstream nodes, allowing you to compute, extract, or reshape the data.

Common use cases include:

* SQL query results
* Data returned from HTTP requests  It helps convert these outputs into the variable formats and field values needed by downstream nodes.

### JSON Variable Mapping

Maps complex JSON structures into variables that are easier to use in later workflow steps.

Common use cases include:

* Extracting key fields from nested JSON returned by APIs or SQL
* Renaming fields or adjusting array structures
* Preparing cleaner variables for subsequent nodes

With this plugin, you avoid repeatedly configuring deep field paths in every node.

## Adjustments for existing customers

Your entitlements will remain unchanged. We will refund plugin points as follows:

* *Lifetime use, 1-year upgrade* → 2 points
* *Lifetime use & upgrade* → 4 points

These adjustments will be completed for all existing customers by November 23, 2025, and NocoBase’s parent company will provide the final interpretation.

## In closing

Thank you to all NocoBase users and open-source contributors. Your feedback and issues help us improve with every release. We will continue to move faster and deliver stronger capabilities at a more friendly price.
