## **Challenges: Surge of Cases and Diversifying Demands**

Bestone undertakes many legal cases yearly as a large-scale legal service provider and faces two main challenges.

**Firstly, the significant increase in new businesses resulted in a decrease in the tool's efficiency.**

In the beginning, Bestone used an online workbook to record new cases, which was convenient and quick when there were few cases. However, as cases surged, entry efficiency decreased, and management difficulty increased dramatically.

The operation team frequently needs to swiftly access historical case information and conduct batch analysis to make decisions. However, utilizing an online workbook for in-depth analysis presents numerous drawbacks.

**In addition, the diversifying and changing market demand led to more complex processes.**

The market for cases and customer needs is becoming more diverse. Bestone needed to match different processing processes to accommodate various cases, often consuming much labor and time. Therefore, finding the optimal solution for entering and processing case information has been a long-standing problem for the operations team.

Moreover, Bestone's management panel constantly adjusts its marketing strategy to ensure a wide range of services. The adjustments will change the requirements of business specifications and quality inspection standards.

To sum up, the issues faced by Bestone had imposed extremely high requirements for the technical solution chosen by Bestone's technical team, which should:

* be able to respond quickly to changing needs;
* deeply tailor for Bestone's and be agile enough to adjust continuously.

## From Online Workbooks to the Legal Case Management System

The search for the solution has undergone in-depth thinking and careful evaluation to meet the needs of all parties. Like other large companies, Bestone initially considered developing an in-house low-code system to cope with the rapidly changing needs of the business, but it was clear that it would be a great deal of work.

As a result, Bestone began searching for a mature low-code provider that could meet their requirements. After conducting thorough market research and comparative analysis, the team finally selected NocoBase for its outstanding features, hoping it could become the key to solving the problem.
