![NocoBase and OutSystems.jpg](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/730dfc5d239d740b832048678fab54f6.jpg)

Why compare these two platforms? Because they represent **two distinct approaches** to low-code development:

* **NocoBase** – It is an open-source, plugin-based, AI-driven low-code application development platform built around a data model–driven approach. With the support of AI-driven capabilities, it offers a high level of customization and flexibility, making it suitable for technical teams building tailored business systems.
* **OutSystems** – A **closed-source enterprise low-code platform**. It offers an all-in-one development and deployment solution, catering to large enterprises looking for **rapid deployment with official support**.

Both platforms have their strengths and serve different use cases. This article will explore their differences in depth, focusing on the **open-source vs. closed-source** debate, helping businesses and developers determine which low-code platform best suits their needs.

## Open-Source vs. Closed-Source

When choosing between an open-source or closed-source low-code platform, **scalability, integration capabilities, and cost** are the three key factors influencing long-term technical decisions.

Let’s start with **scalability**. Open-source platforms like NocoBase offer full access to the source code, giving businesses complete control over customization and data management. In contrast, closed-source platforms like OutSystems impose vendor restrictions, limiting flexibility in extending functionality and handling data.
But scalability isn’t the only concern—**seamless system integration is critical for businesses**.

### Integration Capabilities

NocoBase follows a **microkernel + plugin architecture**, making it highly extensible:

* **Modular plugin system** – Easily add, modify, or remove features to fit specific needs.
* **Flexible API access** – REST APIs enable smooth integration with enterprise tools like ERP, CRM, and BI systems.
* **Customizable data models** – Supports advanced data structures, connecting directly to MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more.

![NocoBase.png](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/1f85f7ac24429c43f5a9caa4830d85c0.png)

⠀OutSystems, on the other hand, provides a structured enterprise integration framework:

* **Pre-configured integrations** – Works with SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft Azure, and other enterprise solutions.
* **Enterprise connectors** – Offers a library of API connectors, though some require an additional subscription.
* **Limited SDK/API customization** – Extending functionalities is constrained by OutSystems’ official SDK, and some API access is locked behind enterprise licensing. 
  Cost is another major consideration, which I’ll analyze later in this article. Now, let’s take a closer look at their **core features**.
