## **Closing Thoughts**

The Q1 2025 GitHub Star Growth Chart confirms one thing: the low-code/no-code movement is alive and thriving. n8n’s explosive growth reflects the ongoing demand for robust workflow automation. Supabase, AppFlowy, and NocoDB continue to maintain momentum, while newer contenders like NocoBase and Windmill are rapidly gaining visibility.

This trend suggests a broader industry shift—from building generic platforms to solving real-world, domain-specific problems. Going forward, the winners will be those who nail the details: AI-native workflows, permission systems, performance, and developer customization.

Want to explore the power of open-source low-code for yourself? Pick one of these projects and try it out. GitHub stars may draw attention, but it’s usability, extensibility, and deployability that win developer loyalty.
