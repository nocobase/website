## **Introduction**

As a leading no-code application development platform under Google, AppSheet has helped millions of enterprises quickly build mobile and web applications covering scenarios such as project management, data collection, and automated processes since its establishment in 2012. This has been achieved through its code-free visual interface, deep integration with the Google ecosystem (Sheets/Drive/AI), and cloud collaboration and cross-platform compatibility capabilities.

Despite AppSheet's excellent performance in the no-code development field, we have found some discussions on Reddit where users want to replace AppSheet:

🔴 **High Costs (Especially for Small Teams)**

*"I have been using AppSheet to make various workflow apps for my business. However AppSheet is asking for a plan upgrade to continue allowing user login. Although I love AppSheet, \$50/mo is too steep for the 4-5 users accessing the app. Does anyone else know of any similar options that sync well with google sheets? Can I somehow launch my own apps subscription free?"*

🔴 **Vendor Lock-in**

*"I'll soon be looking to switch some business operations away from Google, and this may also involve moving away from Appsheet. I was wondering if anyone has found any good alternatives, with user permissions, possibly an option for self hosting."*

🔴 **Performance Issues**

*"I have a fairly large inventory system built into appsheet, but Appsheet is slow, especially with the addition of virtual columns for billing. Is there another platform I can transition to?"*

🔴 **Data Privacy & Self-Hosting Needs**

*"I am looking for a selfhosted database type app, something similar to Ragic and Google Appsheet. Preferably with a mobile app, user management and pwrmissions, and multi user / server signin for simple account switching. Any suggestions?"*

Next, we will focus on recommending 5 open-source alternatives to AppSheet from these perspectives, including [NocoBase](https://www.nocobase.com/), Budibase, Directus, Appsmith, and ToolJet.
