On Reddit, discussions around IT ticketing systems often reveal a common challenge: finding the right balance between **simplicity, flexibility, and cost**.

[One sysadmin running IT operations solo at a small office said:](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1282l0y/best_opensource_it_ticketing_system/)

> “I'm looking for the best open-source IT ticketing system to self-host for a SOHO. It needs to include asset management, LDAP integration for user population, and self-service ticket submission for customers. I'm the only operator.”

[An IT team from an SME shared:](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITManagers/comments/1mt7oy4/modern_it_ticketing_system_with_automation/)：

> “We’re finally replacing our outdated ticketing system. We want something modern, easy to implement, and automation-friendly — but there are just too many options, and the pricing varies wildly. We don’t know where to start.”

[Another team described their daily operational needs:](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1mc82jv/free_open_source_ticketing_system_for_it_support/)

> “We need email-to-ticket automation, notifications for clients and managers, and multi-level escalation workflows. Is there any free, open-source solution that can cover all these scenarios?”

These scattered discussions highlight the same underlying reality:

* For **solo IT admins or small teams**, many ticketing systems are too complex and expensive to set up and maintain.
* For **growing companies**, choosing the right solution is overwhelming due to the trade-offs between features, cost, and usability.
* For **teams with well-defined business processes**, existing tools often lack flexibility and can’t fully align with specific workflows.

**While there are plenty of off-the-shelf ticketing systems, most fail to balance easy adoption with deep customization.**

So, instead of compromising with prebuilt tools, why not build a fully customized ticketing system using an **open-source no-code or low-code platform**?
