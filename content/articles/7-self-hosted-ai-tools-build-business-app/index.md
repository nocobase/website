Over the past year, we have kept a close eye on the self-hosting ecosystem.

What started with [system setup guides](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-awesome-self-hosted-solutions) soon expanded into deep dives on [data management and tool recommendations](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/data-transformation-tools). We even compiled [The Top 13 Self-Hosted Projects with the Most GitHub Stars](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/self-hsosted-projects-list).

As AI becomes part of the picture, self-hosting is entering a more practical and capable phase.

More platforms now integrate AI into their systems so that AI can access local data, produce content, execute tasks, and even take part directly in business workflows. This brings teams greater flexibility and enhanced security.

In this article, we focus on self-hosting from a fresh angle.

> When AI meets self-hosting, which tools can truly speed up business application development?

Here are seven projects that stand out.

Each supports self-hosted deployment and helps teams build AI-enabled business systems quickly while maintaining data privacy and flexible expansion.
