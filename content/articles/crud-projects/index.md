Library is a practical example aimed at helping people understand how to apply Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in the real world. Library focuses on a library management system, similar to what public libraries use to manage books, readers, borrowing, and returns.

The project uses a modular monolithic architecture, with each bounded context allocated to a separate package, demonstrating complex business processes through rich domain logic and CRUD operations. This project not only shows how to build complex business logic but also bridges the gap between theory and practice with real code.

**Key Features**

* **Rich Domain Model**: The Library project uses a domain model to handle complex business logic, such as the book borrowing process, utilizing a hexagonal architecture to separate domain and application logic.
* **Flexible CRUD Application**: For book catalog management, the project applies CRUD architecture to handle relatively simple domain logic.
* **Event-Driven Consistency**: Library uses events to manage communication between aggregates, supporting immediate and eventual consistency options, demonstrating how to achieve these functions via domain event interfaces.

**Use Cases**

* **Library Management Systems**: Manage processes such as book borrowing, returns, and reservations, suitable for systems dealing with complex business logic and rules.
* **Education and Research**: As a DDD implementation example, suitable for academic research and educational training, helping understand the details and challenges of domain-driven design in practical applications.
* **Software Architecture Design**: Provides practical architecture design experience for software developers, especially in using DDD and event-driven architecture.
