You may not be familiar with the concept of Core App Dashboard, but you certainly know what a dashboard is.

From car dashboards that display speed and fuel levels to fitness trackers monitoring steps and heart rates, and financial dashboards keeping track of stock and fund performance, these tools visualize real-time data to help us make data-driven decisions quickly.

In the digital age, with the explosive growth of data and increasingly complex business demands, companies are seeking real-time monitoring, analysis, and decision-making support, leading to the emergence of Core App Dashboard.

It integrates key information from various data sources—such as sales data, customer feedback, market trends, and internal operational efficiency—and transforms this complex data into intuitive charts and metrics. Through a Core App Dashboard, decision-makers can grasp the overall business situation at a glance, identify problems and opportunities promptly, and make data-driven decisions.
