Airtable has changed the perception of data management tools. Many previously viewed data handling as tedious and complex, but Airtable’s visual and simplified design has made data management more accessible and enjoyable. Moreover, it enables non-technical users to create customized databases, breaking down technological barriers and helping Airtable spread rapidly. Later, Airtable introduced more integrated features, such as automation workflows, APIs, and third-party application integrations, further boosting team productivity.
