## **About the University of Siena**

Established in 1240, the University of Siena (Italy: Università degli Studi di Siena, UNISI) is one of the oldest academic institutions in Europe. Located in the historic town of Tuscany, the university is renowned for its law and medical schools. It has campuses in various cities across the region, including Arezzo, Grosseto, and San Giovanni Valdarno, and offers a wide range of study programs and research initiatives across 15 disciplinary departments.

## How to Discover the Optimal Solution for Data Management and User Interaction?

At the University of Siena, students are a top priority. That means ensuring they have the education, experiences, and support they need to graduate and live successfully.

To meet the diverse demands of students and staff, a dedicated team of experts from the University of Siena's e-learning support service sector, continuous training, and technology team came together to find a solution to simplify and optimize the flow of data management and user interaction.

This small but dedicated team embarked on a journey to commit to innovative, cutting-edge solutions to serve students and faculties better.

The improvement of education management at the University of Siena involved the following critical processes:

* integrating existing administrative systems.
* delivering educational content via video conferencing platforms.
* managing e-learning platform support tickets.
* supporting FAQs.
* collecting data from students and professors for administrative purpose

While implementing these features, the University aimed to provide an intuitive user interface to interact with complex existing systems. However, they didn't want to rely on highly customized code that could introduce more system pitfalls. The University of Siena needed a solution that could quickly implement new requirements and flexibly interface with complicated systems.

The team searched for an effective solution and tried several [CRUD solutions](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/how-to-build-efficient-crud-apps), but none fully met their needs. These solutions either lacked the flexibility to accommodate the University's complex administrative processes or required extensive programming effort to implement customized functions. The team also found that many existing tools could have performed better when working with large-scale data, making integrating seamlessly with their existing systems difficult. Additionally, these solutions often required a long learning curve, which posed a significant hurdle for faculty and staff from non-technical backgrounds.

These challenges reduced work efficiency and limited the University's ability to adapt to a rapidly changing educational environment.

## **NocoBase Led to Enhanced Educational Infrastructure**

Until the team discovered NocoBase in 2023, the unique no-code tool with a perfect blend of user-friendliness and powerful features, they finally found the key to solving the problems they faced over the years.

After implementing NocoBase, the team quickly found it easy to define complex layouts and involve customized features. NocoBase's plugin architecture and workflow capabilities significantly simplified the team's operations and improved overall efficiency.

By using Nocabase, the team was able to:

* Use the WYSIWYG UI design interface to build pages quickly.
* Integrate with existing video conferencing platforms with [NocoBase's API](https://docs.nocobase.com/api).
* Configure automated workflows to handle the assignment and tracking of support requests.

Unlike previous solutions, NocoBase didn't require tedious prerequisite steps, allowing the team to focus on core tasks without being bogged down by technical details.

In addition, NocoBase seamlessly integrated with MySQL databases, simplifying data manipulation and improving query efficiency, which made large-scale data management more efficient. As a result, the University of Siena team reconsidered and redesigned their database to fully leverage NocoBase's capabilities.

> "Currently, we are making substantial changes to our database to adapt it to NocoBase's features, confident that it will provide us with an even more straightforward and powerful development base than we had previously thought. "

Furthermore, NocoBase's flexibility and user-friendly interface motivated the team to create new services and investigate inventive solutions. This has allowed the University of Siena team to enhance the end-user experience and streamline internal processes, which was previously thought impossible. These changes have significantly improved the University of Siena's educational infrastructure.

## **Results and Benefits**

One of the main reasons the team chose Nocobase was its development speed, but the platform turned out to be much more than that.

By implementing systems with Nocobase, the University of Siena team not only boosted productivity but also observed a significant enhancement in overall user experience. Nocobase's intuitive and customizable interface improved operational efficiency and user satisfaction. Secondly, seamless integration with the platform simplifies data management and exchange, facilitating collaboration among team members.

For example, NocoBase will dramatically improve the University's e-learning support services. Teachers will be able to easily browse and manage course content, schedule video conferences, and respond to student support requests easily. The system will streamline the workflow, resulting in a 50% reduction in the average wait time for students and a nearly 30% increase in teacher productivity. This directly contributes to a more positive learning experience and higher student satisfaction.
