## Introduction

NocoBase Russia, our branch, is actively exploring how no-code can deliver more efficient digital solutions across different industries.NocoBase has proven to be highly versatile in practice:

* Streamline task, document, and HR management within enterprises
* Support ticketing, registration, and media management at large cultural events
* Enable unified registration and data management across regions in nationwide education programs

From small teams to large-scale projects with tens of thousands of participants, our platform has been leveraged for rapid development and flexible expansion, achieving significant efficiency gains for organizations across Russia.

## What We Achieved

### Matreshka Market

Matreshka Market is a platform that connects local Russian producers, helping small and medium-sized businesses and entrepreneurs network, showcase their products, and drive the growth of domestic production.

As the team grew, daily operations depended on several separate tools—task management, document storage, HR, and financial records. With information scattered across different platforms, communication became inefficient and onboarding new members increasingly complex.

#### Solution

With our team's support, the Matreshka Market team built an all-in-one internal system on our platform:

* **Task and project management**: A custom task tracker and kanban board linked progress directly with documents and team members.

![Task2.png](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Task%20and%20project%20management2-3euhcq.png)

* **Document hub**: Centralized technical and project materials created a living knowledge base, making it easy for new members to get up to speed.

* **HR and employee database:** Profiles recorded roles, departments, hours, leave, and payroll—replacing the old Excel sheets.

* **Automation and notifications**: Integrated with Telegram Bot to push task updates and reminders, ensuring timely communication.

#### Outcomes

* Migrated over 80% of internal processes to NocoBase
* Replaced more than four external services (task management, CRM, Wiki, Excel)
* Boosted response speed by 40% through automation and notifications
* Significantly improved onboarding, with new hires able to integrate quickly

Using our platform, the Matreshka Market team created a digital workplace of their own—free from reliance on external templates and designed to evolve with their needs.

### Flat White Champ

Every year in St. Petersburg, Russia, hundreds of dancers gather for the Flat White Champ dance festival. The event offers newcomers a stage to shine and gives professionals a high-level platform to perform. From live shows to high-quality livestreams, and through partnerships in tourism and culture, the festival has become a vital part of the city's cultural scene.

But organizing the festival was never easy. Registration, ticketing, merchandise sales, volunteer scheduling, and media storage all relied on manual work or scattered tools—making operations labor-intensive and error-prone. With growing participation year after year, the team urgently needed a more reliable system.

#### Solution

Our platform was used to transform the way the festival is managed. Organizers built a complete digital system that included:

* **Registration and sign-up**: Contestants register through personal accounts, with all details stored in the CRM and linked to orders and event records.

* **Ticketing and entry**\*\*: Each ticket generates a unique QR code, enabling fast check-in and smoother on-site operations.

* **Online store**: Tickets and merchandise are managed in one system, directly connected to participant and spectator data.

* **Volunteer and team management**: The CRM tracks staff and volunteer roles, schedules, and past involvement for easy coordination.

![Volunteer.png](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Volunteer%20and%20team%20management-ratjzx.png)

* **Media and file storage**: Using S3 storage, all photos and videos are linked to event details, ensuring reliable access and easy distribution.

#### Outcomes

With our platform, almost all festival processes are now automated, cutting manual work by 60%. The system can be reused for future festivals and runs reliably even during peak days. Data is more accurate, and errors have dropped significantly.

For Flat White Champ, NocoBase platform is not just a management tool—it's part of the event experience. It empowers dancers, audiences, and organizers to immerse themselves in the passion of dance, supported by a seamless digital system.

### "Я в деле" (I'm In)

"I'm In" is a nationwide youth entrepreneurship initiative supported by the Russian Ministry of Education and Science. Spanning 72 regions across Russia, the program provides end-to-end support for tens of thousands of students - from shaping ideas to bringing them to life. In just eight weeks, participants work with mentors and entrepreneurs to refine their concepts into real projects and present them at the national forum.

Managing a program of this scale comes with major challenges. Previously, student registration and check-in relied on manual forms—slow and error-prone. Course and workshop sign-ups lacked centralized management, causing confusion. Meanwhile, organizers also needed a way to track interactions and outcomes between mentors and students.

#### Solution

Our team used our platform to create a unified digital system for the program:

* **Student registration and check-in**: Each participant registers online and receives a unique QR code. This serves as both an entry pass and a way for organizers to access complete personal information, cutting verification time dramatically.

![check-in.png](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Student%20registration%20and%20check-in-tmmwbo.png)

* **Course and activity management**: Students can log into their accounts to browse available lectures and workshops, check real-time availability, and reserve a spot. The system updates automatically, preventing overbooking or duplicate sign-ups.

![Course.png](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Course%20and%20activity%20management-6hp9cl.png)

* **CRM management**: All contact details and participation records—whether for students, mentors, or experts—are stored in a single CRM, giving organizers clear oversight and ensuring project progress remains transparent.

#### Outcomes

* Centralized registration data from 72 regions, ensuring far greater consistency
* Entry efficiency improved several times, with wait and verification times sharply reduced
* More accurate tracking of participation and outcomes, with duplicate or incorrect records minimized

For "I'm In," our platform is more than just a technical fix—it's what makes the program scalable. As the initiative continues to grow, the team can build on the same system, providing even more young people with the opportunity to bring their entrepreneurial ideas to life.

## Our Experience in Russia

## Looking Ahead

From Matreshka Market's internal management to Flat White Champ's cultural events, and nationwide programs like "I'm In," our team has demonstrated the real value of the work we do: understanding client needs and turning them into practical systems with speed and precision.

This is the shared goal we pursue with our partners: **enabling more organizations to realize digital solutions that fit their needs—faster and at lower cost.**

We also look forward to welcoming new partners to jointly expand NocoBase's capabilities in new industries and use cases, helping more teams achieve their goals.
