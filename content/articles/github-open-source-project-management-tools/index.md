Last week, we recommended a set of project management tools for **small businesses**, based on real discussions and needs shared by Reddit users:

[Project Management Systems for Small Businesses: Real Needs from Reddit Users](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/project-management-systems-for-small-businesses)

For developers and technical teams, however, **open-source tools** often provide even greater advantages. Not only do they help reduce costs, but they also allow for higher levels of **customization** and **extensibility**. The popularity of this topic is clear: the **[project-management](https://github.com/topics/project-management)** tag on GitHub already has 19.9k **followers**, highlighting the strong community interest in open-source project management solutions.

![GitHub](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/GitHub-zjxwk7.png)

Based on this topic, we selected the top 10 projects ranked by GitHub Stars. These range from lightweight Kanban boards to full-featured enterprise-grade platforms, covering task management, team collaboration, and R&D workflows. Our goal is to help developers evaluate each tool’s practical usability, scalability, and real-world application value.

In making our recommendations, we focused on three dimensions:

* **Core Value** – How the tool addresses real pain points in project management for development teams.
* **Unique Highlights** – Which features set it apart from other tools.
* **Recommended Scenarios** – The team size and development model it best suits.

Below, we’ll introduce the top 10 open-source project management tools on GitHub, giving you a clear overview of their features and ideal use cases.
