* [Top 11 Open-Source Admin Dashboard Projects on GitHub](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/top-11-open-source-admin-dashboard-projects-on-github)

In this post, we’re focusing on **Web Applications**. We searched through the [web-application](https://github.com/topics/web-application) and [web-app](https://github.com/topics/web-app) GitHub topics, and picked projects with **over 10,000 stars** and a clear use case. These include platforms for publishing, data visualization, low-code app building, and more.

To help you quickly understand and evaluate each project, we’ve broken down the analysis into three simple parts:

* **What it does** – What problem does the project solve, and who is it for?
* **How to use it** – Is it easy to deploy and test?
* **How it’s built** – What’s the tech stack, and is it easy to extend or learn from?
