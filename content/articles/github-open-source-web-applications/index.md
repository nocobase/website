To help you quickly understand and evaluate each project, we’ve broken down the analysis into three simple parts:

* **What it does** – What problem does the project solve, and who is it for?
* **How to use it** – Is it easy to deploy and test?
* **How it’s built** – What’s the tech stack, and is it easy to extend or learn from?
