## Introduction

Over the past year, AI and no-code have come together much faster than anyone expected. **It’s no longer just about adding an AI feature — it’s changing the way we build applications.**

No-code is also going through a clear shift: instead of simply designing interfaces, creating data models, and setting up workflows, we’re moving toward a new stage where AI helps model data, generate logic, and work alongside us to build entire systems. And this shift is already happening in real products — not just as a concept.
