Nowadays, it’s hard to imagine life without task management software (or task management systems).

Whether for personal use, managing *[tasks handled by project managers](https://jooble.org/career-advice/what-does-a-project-manager-do/)*, or coordinating team projects within a company, task management tools are part of our daily routines. You’ve likely used some popular tools like Asana, Jira, or Notion.

These tools are powerful and convenient, but you may have noticed that they come with high costs or limited customization, which may not fully meet your specific needs.

That’s why today, we’re exploring a more flexible and controllable solution: **open-source task management software.**

In this article, I’ll share 8 outstanding open-source projects that can help you build a task management system tailored to your needs, saving costs and offering greater freedom and customization.
