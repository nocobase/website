## Introduction

Dear reader, congratulations on creating a foundational task management system! But this is only the beginning. Just like building a house, the groundwork is laid, and now we begin constructing each layer, elevating the system to be even more comprehensive and powerful.

## Achievements So Far

- Developed essential task data management features.
- Enabled multiple views for task data presentation ([Table](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/ui/blocks/data-blocks/table), [Kanban](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/block-kanban), [Calendar](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/calendar), [Gantt charts](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/block-gantt)
- Configured [Notifications](https://docs-cn.nocobase.com/handbook/notification-in-app-message) for task ownership changes.

## Future Development Vision

### 1. Knowledge Base

Picture a hub where your team’s documents, expertise, and insights converge. How can we effectively organize and retrieve this knowledge? We’re designing a multi-functional Knowledge Center:

- Hierarchical document structure for organized, intuitive browsing [(Tree Collection)](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/collection-tree).
- Support for diverse document types: technical guides, team wiki, announcements.
- Robust access controls for secure information sharing (permissions, status, rules).

### 2. Personalized Dashboard

Everyone needs a workspace that reflects their unique priorities:

- Task Focus Area: Highlight crucial, time-sensitive tasks (filtered view).
- Visual Progress Tracking: Clear data charts that bring work progress to life [(Chart)](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/data-visualization/user/chart-block).
- Customized Information Display: Tailor the dashboard to display what matters most to you (document library/announcements).

### 3. Subtask Management

Some tasks are like an elephant that needs to be "eaten" bit by bit:

- Task Breakdown: Split large tasks into manageable subtasks.
- Progress Tracking: Easily monitor both the big picture and detailed progress.
- Multi-Level Organization: Support for nested subtasks with a clear hierarchy.

### 4. Time Tracking and Progress Reporting (Optional)

See project progress in a single glance:

- Daily time logs.
- Progress updates and status tracking.
- Work hours statistics and analytics.
- Visualized progress displays.

### 5. Meeting Room Booking Management(Optional)

Make meetings productive rather than a burden:

- Scheduling and managing meeting agendas.
- Room reservations.
- ...

### 6. Towards a Complete Project Management Platform

Our ultimate objective is to unify all these features into a robust project management platform that meets the evolving needs of any team. As we advance, future additions might include:

- Cost Analysis.
- Project Performance Analytics.
- …

## Conclusion

In the following sections, we’ll bring each of these features to life, one by one. With each step, your system will grow stronger and more capable. Remember, Rome wasn’t built in a day—we’re taking it step by step, ensuring each component integrates smoothly and works flawlessly.

Are you ready to embark on this exciting journey of transformation? Let’s press on!
