## Introduction

Welcome to the world of **NocoBase**! In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, companies and development teams often encounter challenges like:

- **Frequent changes in business needs**, making it difficult for traditional development approaches to respond quickly.
- **Tight and urgent delivery deadlines**, with complex processes that lead to inefficiencies.
- **Limited capabilities of no-code platforms**, which may not meet complex needs.
- **Challenges in ensuring data privacy and system stability**.
- **Difficulties integrating with existing systems**, impacting overall efficiency.
- **User or application-based charges**, making cost management challenging.

**NocoBase** was designed specifically to tackle these issues. As a **highly extensible no-code development platform**, NocoBase offers the following unique advantages:

- **Free, open-source, flexible, and fast**: Open-source code with active community support. Install, deploy, and develop in minutes.
- **Highly extensible**: Micro-kernel architecture with modular design, where all features are offered as plugins.
- **Unique core concepts**: Build systems through the combination of data sources, blocks, and operations, ensuring a smooth, intuitive experience.
- **What you see is what you get**: An intuitive UI editor for seamless interface design.
- **Data-driven**: Supports multiple data sources, with data structure and interface decoupled.

## NocoBase’s Design Goals

NocoBase strikes a fine balance between **ease of use**, **powerful functionality**, and **low complexity**. It offers a wide range of functional modules to meet diverse needs while keeping the user interface simple and intuitive. Additionally, its **plugin mechanism** allows users to expand platform capabilities, enabling highly customized extensions that ensure system flexibility and sustainability.

With this introduction, you should now have a foundational understanding of **NocoBase**. This tutorial series will emphasize hands-on project practice, guiding you step-by-step through NocoBase’s core concepts and setup process, and ultimately enabling you to build a streamlined, efficient task management system.

## Why Choose a Task Management System?

A task management system is an ideal introductory project for beginners:

- It closely aligns with everyday needs.
- It has a simple structure with strong extensibility, allowing it to expand from basic task management into a complete project management system.

This tutorial will start with beginner-friendly features, covering NocoBase’s core modules and operations, such as task creation, commenting, permission management, and notification settings. By the end, you’ll have a comprehensive understanding of NocoBase’s foundational functions.

### Core Concepts Integrated with Task Management

Throughout each chapter, we’ll explore NocoBase’s core concepts in depth, including:

- **Collections**: The system’s foundational data structure, such as collections for tasks, users, and comments, providing the system’s information base.
- **Blocks**: Data displays on pages, supporting multiple presentation styles. Blocks allow for dynamic data presentations in tasks like creation, editing, viewing, and management. Additional features (e.g., comment blocks) can also be added through plugins.
- **Actions**: Actions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data, allowing users to manage tasks and comments to meet various needs.
- **Plugin Extensions**: All features in NocoBase are delivered through plugins, offering high extensibility. This tutorial will introduce Markdown and comment plugins to add useful features for task descriptions and team collaboration.
- **Workflow**: One of NocoBase’s highlights. This tutorial will walk you through basic automated workflows, such as task owner reminders, to give you a firsthand experience of the power of workflows.
