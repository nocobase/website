## 1 Understanding the Concept of API Keys

Before we begin, it's important to understand: What is an API Key? It works like an entry ticket that verifies whether an API request comes from an authorized user. When you access the NocoBase system via a website, mobile app, or backend script, this "secret key" quickly validates your identity.

In the HTTP request header, you'll see a format like:

```txt
Authorization: Bearer {API key}
```

Here, "Bearer" indicates that what follows is a validated API Key, which allows the system to quickly confirm the requester's permissions.

In practice, API Keys are commonly used in the following scenarios:

1. **Client-side Application Access**: When users access the API through a web browser or mobile app, the system uses the API Key to verify the user's identity, ensuring that only authorized users can retrieve data.
2. **Automated Task Execution**: Background scheduled tasks or scripts use API Keys to ensure that updates or logging actions are secure and authorized.
3. **Development and Testing**: Developers use API Keys during debugging and testing to simulate real requests and ensure that the interfaces respond correctly.

In short, API Keys not only help confirm the identity of the requester but also monitor usage, limit request frequency, and prevent potential security threats, thereby safeguarding the stable operation of NocoBase.

## 2 Creating [API Keys](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys) in NocoBase

### 2.1 Activate the Auth: [API Keys](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys) Plugin

First, make sure that the built-in Auth: [API Keys](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys) plugin in NocoBase is activated. Once activated, the system settings center will feature a new configuration page for [API keys](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys).

![20250301003106](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250301003106.png)

### 2.2 Create a Test To Dos Collection

For testing purposes, create a collection named `todos` (To Dos collection) with the following fields:

- `id`
- `title`
- `completed`

![20250303175632](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250303175632.png)

Then, enter a few sample to-dos into the collection, such as:

- eat food
- sleep
- play games

![20250303180044](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250303180044.png)

### 2.3 Create and Bind a Role

Since [API keys](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys) are bound to user roles, the system determines request permissions based on the role. Therefore, before creating an [API key](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys), you need to create a role and assign the appropriate permissions. It is recommended to create a test role called "To Dos API Role" and assign all permissions for the To Dos collection to this role.

![20250303180247](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250303180247.png)

If "To Dos API Role" is not available when creating an [API key](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys), it may be because the current user has not been assigned this role. In that case, please assign this role to the current user:

![20250303180638](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250303180638.png)

After assigning the role, refresh the page and navigate to the API key management page. Click "Add API Key," and you should see the "To Dos API Role" role available.

![20250303180612](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250303180612.png)
![20250303180936](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250303180936.png)

For more precise management, you can also create a dedicated "To Dos API User" to log into the system, test permissions, and manage [API keys](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys). Simply assign the "To Dos API Role" to this user.
![20250304134443](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250304134443.png)
![20250304134713](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250304134713.png)
![20250304134734](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250304134734.png)

### 2.4 Create and Save the [API Key](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys)

After clicking submit, the system will display a prompt indicating that the [API key](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys) has been created successfully, and the key will be shown in a popup. Be sure to copy and save this key, as it will not be shown again for security reasons.

![20250303181130](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250303181130.png)

For example, you might receive an [API key](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys) like this:

```txt
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsInJvbGVOYW1lIjoidG9kb3MiLCJpYXQiOjE3NDA5OTY1ODAsImV4cCI6MzMyOTg1OTY1ODB9.tXF2FCAzFNgZFPXqSBbWAfEvWkQwz0-mtKnmOTZT-5M
```

### 2.5 Notes

- The validity period of the [API key](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys) depends on the duration you selected when applying.
- The generation and verification of the [API key](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys) are closely tied to the `APP_KEY` environment variable. Do not modify it arbitrarily, or all [API keys](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys) in the system will become invalid.

## 3 Testing the [API Key](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys)’s Validity

### 3.1 Using the [API document](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-doc) Plugin

Open the [API document](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-doc) plugin, where you can view the request method, URL, parameters, and header information for each API.

![20250303181522](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250303181522.png)
![20250303181704](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250303181704.png)

### 3.2 Understanding the Basic CRUD APIs

Below are some basic API examples provided by NocoBase:

- **List Query (list API):**

  ```txt
  GET {baseURL}/{collectionName}:list
  Request Header:
  - Authorization: Bearer <API key>

  ```
- **Create Record (create API):**

  ```txt
  POST {baseURL}/{collectionName}:create

  Request Header:
  - Authorization: Bearer <API key>

  Request Body (in JSON format), for example:
      {
          "title": "123"
      }
  ```
- **Update Record (update API):**

  ```txt
  POST {baseURL}/{collectionName}:update?filterByTk={id}
  Request Header:
  - Authorization: Bearer <API key>

  Request Body (in JSON format), for example:
      {
          "title": "123",
          "completed": true
      }
  ```
- **Delete Record (delete API):**

  ```txt
  POST {baseURL}/{collectionName}:destroy?filterByTk={id}
  Request Header:
  - Authorization: Bearer <API key>
  ```

Here, `{baseURL}` is the URL of your NocoBase system and `{collectionName}` is the collection name. For example, when testing locally, if the address is `localhost:13000` and the collection name is `todos`, the request URL would be:

```txt
http://localhost:13000/todos:list
```

### 3.3 Testing Using Postman (Example with the List API)

Open Postman, create a new GET request, enter the request URL above, and add the `Authorization` header with your [API key](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys) as the value:

```txt
Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsInJvbGVOYW1lIjoidG9kb3MiLCJpYXQiOjE3NDA5OTY1ODAsImV4cCI6MzMyOTg1OTY1ODB9.tXF2FCAzFNgZFPXqSBbWAfEvWkQwz0-mtKnmOTZT-5M
```

![20250303182744](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20250303182744.png)
After sending the request, if everything is set up correctly, you should receive a response similar to the following:

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "createdAt": "2025-03-03T09:57:36.728Z",
            "updatedAt": "2025-03-03T09:57:36.728Z",
            "completed": null,
            "createdById": 1,
            "id": 1,
            "title": "eat food",
            "updatedById": 1
        }
    ],
    "meta": {
        "count": 1,
        "page": 1,
        "pageSize": 20,
        "totalPage": 1
    }
}
```

If the [API key](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys) is not correctly authorized, you might see an error message like:

```json
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "message": "Your session has expired. Please sign in again.",
            "code": "INVALID_TOKEN"
        }
    ]
}
```

In such a case, please check the role permissions, [API key](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/api-keys) binding, and ensure the key format is correct.

### 3.4 Copy the Request Code from Postman

Once the test is successful, you can copy the request code for the List API. For instance, the following curl request example is copied from Postman:

```txt
curl --location 'http://localhost:13000/api/todos:list' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsInJvbGVOYW1lIjoidG9kb3MiLCJpYXQiOjE3NDA5OTY1ODAsImV4cCI6MzMyOTg1OTY1ODB9.tXF2FCAzFNgZFPXqSBbWAfEvWkQwz0-mtKnmOTZT-5M'
```

## 4 Displaying To Dos in an [Iframe Block](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/block-iframe)

To visually demonstrate the effect of API requests, we can use an [Iframe Block](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/block-iframe) to display the list of To Dos fetched from NocoBase. Refer to the sample code below:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Todo List</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Todo List</h1>
    <pre id="result"></pre>

    <script>
        fetch('http://localhost:13000/api/todos:list', {
            method: 'GET',
            headers: {
                'Authorization': 'Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsInJvbGVOYW1lIjoidG9kb3MiLCJpYXQiOjE3NDA5OTY1ODAsImV4cCI6MzMyOTg1OTY1ODB9.tXF2FCAzFNgZFPXqSBbWAfEvWkQwz0-mtKnmOTZT-5M'
            }
        })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            document.getElementById('result').textContent = JSON.stringify(data, null, 2);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error('Error:', error);
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

The above code embeds an [Iframe Block](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/block-iframe) that displays a simple "Todo List". Upon loading, it calls the API to retrieve the To Dos and shows the response (as formatted JSON) within the iframe.

Additionally, the following animation demonstrates the dynamic process of the request:
