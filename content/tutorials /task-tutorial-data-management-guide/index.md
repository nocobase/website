With the requirements of our task management system outlined, it’s time to dive into the practical steps! Recall that our system should support **[Creating](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/ui/actions/types/add-new)**, **[Editing](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/ui/actions/types/edit)**, and **[Deleting](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/ui/actions/types/delete)** tasks, along with **viewing the task list**. All of this functionality can be achieved using NocoBase’s pages, blocks, and actions.

> For further details, see [Menus](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/ui/menus) and [Pages](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/ui/pages) in the official documentation.

### 3.1 How to Begin?

You may remember that we previously covered how to create pages and display user lists. These pages act as canvases where you can arrange various blocks in any order and size. Here’s a quick recap of the steps:

1. [**Create a Page**](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/ui/pages): Just a few clicks, and your page is ready.
   ![Create a Page](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Solution/demoE3v1-01.gif)
2. **Create a [Table Block](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/ui/blocks/data-blocks/table)**: Select a table block to display various data.
   ![Create a Table Block](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Solution/demoE3v1-02.gif)

Simple, right? But upon opening “Data List,” you might notice only the “User” and “Role”collections. Where is the task table? Don’t worry; it’s accessible through NocoBase’s [**Data Source**](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/data-source-manager) feature.

> **About Data Sources:** A data source can be a database, API, or other data storage types. NocoBase supports various relational databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MariaDB.
>
> NocoBase provides a **Data Source Management Plugin** for managing data sources and tables. However, to connect to data sources, you’ll also need specific **Data Source Plugins**.

### 3.2 Data Source: Your Collections Repository

![](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/20241009144356.png)

In NocoBase, all collections are stored within [**Data Sources**](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/data-source-manager), which act like books containing the design and structure of each collection. Let’s add our new chapter by creating a **task collection**.

> To explore more on data sources and collections, refer to [Data Source Management](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/data-source-manager) and [Collection Overview](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/data-modeling/collection).

- **Accessing Data Source Settings**:
  - Click **Settings** > **Data Sources** > **Main Data Source Configuration**.
  - In the main data source, you’ll see existing collections, usually just “User” and “Role” by default.
    ![Data Source Settings](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Solution/demoE3v1-05.gif)

Now, let’s create the third collection – our **task collection**. We’ll follow our previous design to set up a simple task collection with the following fields:

```
Tasks collection:
        Task Name (task_name) Single-line Text
        Task Description (task_description) Multi-line Text
```

### 3.3 Creating the Task collection

1. **Create Task collection**:

   - Click “Create collection” > Select **General collection** > Enter **Collection display name** (e.g., “Task collection”) and **Collection name** (e.g., “tasks”).
   - The **Collection name** is a unique ID, recommended to use English letters, numbers, or underscores for easier reference.
   - Submit to create.
     ![Create Task collection](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Solution/demoE3v1-06.gif)
2. **Default Fields**:
   NocoBase generates default fields for each standard collection:

   - **ID**: A unique identifier for each record.
   - **Created at**: Automatically records when the task was created.
   - **Created By**: Automatically records the task creator.
   - **Last updated at** and **Last updated by**: Records each modification’s date and user.

These default fields are exactly what we need, saving us from adding them manually.

3. **Create Custom Fields**:
   - **Task Name**: Click “Add Field” > Choose **Single line Text** > Set the 'Field display name' to “Task Name,” and the field name as “task_name.”
     ![Create Task Name Field](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Solution/demoE3v1-07.gif)
   - **Task Description**: Add another field of **Long text** with the field name“task_description.”
     ![Create Task Description Field](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Solution/demoE3v1-08.gif)

Congratulations! The **task collection** is now defined, and you have successfully created your own task data structure.

### 3.4 Creating the Task Management Page

With the task collection ready, let’s present it on a page using a table block.

1. **Create Task Management Page**:

   - Click “New Page,” name it “Task Management.”
   - Add a table block to display task data.
     ![Create Task Block](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Solution/demoE3v1-10.gif)
2. **Add Data**:

   - “Hmm, why is there no data?” Don’t worry; let’s add some!
   - Click on “Configure Actions” at the top right, select **Add** action, and you’ll see an empty pop-up container.
   - Next, add a form block > select **Current Collection**.
   - Display the Task Name and Description fields, configure the submit action, and complete the form submission!
     ![Configure Action](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Solution/demoE3v1-11.gif)
3. **Enter Data**:

   - Enter a test task, click submit, and success! Task data has been added.
     ![Submit Data](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Solution/demoE3v1-12.gif)

Exciting time! You successfully entered the first task data, wasn't that easy?

### 3.5 Task Filtering – Quickly Locate Tasks

As tasks increase, how can you find specific ones quickly? Here’s where [**Filter Actions**](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/ui/actions/types/filter) come into play. In NocoBase, you can easily locate tasks by setting filter conditions.

#### 3.5.1 Enabling Filter Actions

First, we need to enable filter actions:

- **Hover over “Configure actions”** and click the **Filter Switch**.
  ![Enable Filter](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Solution/011734175681202414192812.png)

#### 3.5.2 Using Filter Conditions

Once enabled, the filter button appears on the page. Now, let’s test the filter by searching for tasks by **Task Name**:

- In the filter panel, select Task Name, and enter your query.
- Click “Submit” to see if the task list correctly displays the filtered results.
  ![Enable Filter](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Solution/demoE3v1-13.gif)

#### 3.5.3 Disabling Filter Actions

If you no longer need the filter, simply toggle it off:

- **Reset Filter Conditions** to ensure no active filters, then click “Reset.”
- Toggle **Filter** off again to hide it.
  ![Disable Filter](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Solution/demoE3v1-14.gif)

### 3.6 Task Editing and Deletion

In addition to adding and viewing tasks, we also need to be able to [**Edit**](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/ui/actions/types/edit) and [**Delete**](https://docs.nocobase.com/handbook/ui/actions/types/delete) them. Since you’re familiar with adding blocks, fields, and actions, these will be straightforward:

1. **Edit Task**:

   - Add an **Edit** action in the task list configuration. Click Edit > Add Form (Edit) Block > Choose fields to edit.
2. **Delete Task**:

   - Similarly, enable the **Delete** action in the configuration, and the delete button appears. Click Delete > Confirm to remove the task from the list.
     ![Edit and Delete Task](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Solution/demoE3v1-15.gif)

Fantastic! You’ve now implemented **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** functionalities for tasks.

### Challenge Task

As you become more proficient with NocoBase, here’s a little challenge: add a task status and allow attachments.

Hints:

- Add to your Task Collection:
  1. **Status** field, a dropdown with options: **Not Started, In Progress, Pending Review, Completed, Cancelled, Archived**.

2. **Attachment** field.

- Display the **Status** and **Attachment** fields in the Task Collection and the **Add** and **Edit** forms.

  Have any ideas yet? Don’t worry, the [next chapter (Chapter 4: Task and Comment Plugins)](https://www.nocobase.com/en/tutorials/task-tutorial-plugin-use) will reveal the answer. Let’s stay tuned!
